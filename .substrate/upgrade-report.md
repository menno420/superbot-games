## ⚠️ Gate carve-outs (host additions the kit-owned regen could not keep)

- carve-out: .github/workflows/auto-merge-enabler.yml — host-added step 'Skip arming while the PR's own in-diff session card is in-progress' in job 'enable-auto-merge' [carried from the previous upgrade report]
- carve-out: full pre-regen enabler banked at .substrate/backup/auto-merge-enabler.pre-regen-71045852.yml — host additions were NOT carried into the regenerated kit-owned enabler; move them into a separate workflow file (e.g. .github/workflows/host-ci.yml) and commit that before shipping this upgrade/adopt PR. [carried from the previous upgrade report]

## Capability-ledger seed refresh

- capability-seed: docs/CAPABILITIES.md is consumer-untouched — the whole file (fence included) refreshes via `upgrade --apply-docs`; no fence-only refresh needed.

This upgrade ships the venue-scoped capability ledger (grounded-skills §4.2): entries carry a venue token (owner-live · autonomous-project · routine-fired · subagent · any) and the ledger's kit-owned seed block carries the posture decision rule. If this repo carries a local prose copy of the boot-triad/venue-posture rule (superbot Q-0270), that copy is now superseded by docs/CAPABILITIES.md's posture rule — collapse the local copy into a pointer.

## Seat-digest refresh

- seat-digest: docs/seat-digest.md already current — nothing to refresh.
