"""Exploration engine — pure, loadout-aware outcome catalog (foundation).

This module is the structured successor to the flat five-entry
``EXPLORE_OUTCOMES`` table in :mod:`utils.mining.rewards`.  It models
exploration as *depth-banded* (a :class:`Biome`) and *loadout-aware* (the
tools a player has equipped change which outcomes are reachable and how
generous they are), while staying a **pure** domain module: no Discord,
no DB, no I/O.  Randomness is injected so every roll is deterministic
under test.

Design intent (see ``docs/ideas/mining_exploration_brainstorm.md``):

* The engine owns the *catalog* of possible outcomes and the math that
  selects and scales one.  A future exploration **service** would own
  state/mutations, and a registered **renderer** (or the read-only AI
  layer) would turn a :class:`ExploreResult` into buttons / an embed /
  an image.  Keeping selection pure here is what lets the AI "narrate
  and theme" an outcome it is *given* without ever writing state.
* Tool-gating (`requires`) is how a loadout meaningfully drives results:
  a torch unlocks deep finds, dynamite unlocks high-payoff blasted
  veins, a lucky charm scales amounts.  This replaces the current binary
  "owns pickaxe → double".

Nothing in this module is wired into a command yet — it is additive
foundation.  ``resolve_to_legacy_tuple`` returns the exact
``(text, item, amount)`` shape the existing ``!explore`` handler already
consumes, so adoption later is a drop-in, not a rewrite.
