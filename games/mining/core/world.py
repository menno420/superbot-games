"""World / position — pure depth↔biome + descent-gating model (foundation).

The *position* half of the mining "Descent".  A player has a persistent integer
**depth** (stored in ``mining_player_state``); this module maps that depth onto a
:class:`~utils.mining.exploration.Biome` and decides — from the player's equipped
gear :class:`~utils.equipment.EffectiveStats` — how deep they may descend.

Pure: no Discord, no DB, no state.  Sibling to ``exploration.py`` (which owns the
outcome *catalog*) and ``equipment.py`` (which owns the stat block); it reuses
``exploration.BIOME_ORDER`` so the depth↔biome mapping has a single source of
truth.

**Descent-gating decision (brainstorm §6.8 P2).** Depth access is gated by the
already-shipped ``depth_access`` stat from equipped gear — a torch grants access
to depth 1 (Cavern), a lantern depth 2 (Deep) — and is **persistent, not consumed
per descent**.  Consuming a light per descent belongs with the later durability
slice; this keeps position a stable, reversible game constant (one function,
:func:`max_accessible_depth`).

# already clean data and stay put. Byte-identical to the pre-extraction f-strings
# (pinned by test_world_hints.py) — a pure relocation, not a copy change.
