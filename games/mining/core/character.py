"""Character stats — the gear + skills merge point (brainstorm §7.4).

The single read model for "how strong is this character?", combining equipped
gear (:func:`utils.equipment.compute_stats`) with allocated skill points
(:func:`utils.mining.skills.skill_stats`) into one
:class:`~utils.equipment.EffectiveStats` block.  Game logic (mining descent,
deathmatch) reads *this*, never gear or skills separately, so adding skills did
not touch any game's stat math.

Pure + stdlib-only.  An **empty allocation makes the result byte-identical to
gear-only stats** — the additive safety property that lets the skill tree ship
without changing existing play (asserted in
``tests/unit/utils/test_character_stats.py``).
