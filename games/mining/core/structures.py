"""Mining structures — pure build/gating math for the §7.5 structure sinks.

Slice B of ``docs/planning/mining-structures-skill-tree-plan-2026-06-14.md``: the
**Forge**, a *built* structure (coin + material sink) that unlocks higher-tier
gear crafting, tying the structure ladder into the existing 5-tier gear ladder
(``utils.equipment``).  The ``mining_structures`` table is generic
(``(user, guild, structure, level)``) so later slices — the Home backdrop
(Slice C) — reuse the same store and this module's ``BuildCost`` shape.

Design (kept **additive**): the forge requirement is derived from a recipe's
gear tier, but only the **top two** tiers gate — bronze / iron / silver gear,
every tool, and every structure stay craftable at forge level 0, so existing
play is unchanged until a player reaches gold/diamond gear.  Gold needs a level-1
forge, diamond a level-2 forge, and the forge is cheap and buildable immediately,
so the gate is a progression beat, not a wall.

Numbers here are the **pinned defaults** — see
``docs/planning/forge-numbers-2026-06-15.md`` (mirrored by
``tests/unit/utils/test_mining_structures.py``).  This is a ``utils`` module: it
imports stdlib + ``utils.equipment`` only (no services / db), so the service,
view, and cog layers share one source of truth for the math.
