"""Mining workshop — pure durability/repair/craft helpers (RS02 split).

pricing (derived from the market's ``GEAR_SHOP`` so one knob tunes both
sinks), durability bars, craftable-gear listings, and the wear plan
(which equipped slots wear on which action).  No I/O — the multi-write
orchestration (wear ticks, repair, craft, quick-craft) lives in
``services/mining_workflow.py``, the audited mining write boundary.
