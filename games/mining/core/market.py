"""Mining market — pure pricing (sell values + the gear shop).

The *pure* half of the market (RS02 split): what an ore sells for, what
gear costs, and the typed :class:`TradeResult` every mining operation
returns.  No I/O — the money/inventory orchestration lives in
``services/mining_workflow.py`` (one transaction per operation).

Sell prices reuse :func:`utils.mining.items.item_value` so "what an ore
is worth" has a single source of truth; the gear shop is a small,
tunable coin catalogue — the balance knob for the economy loop.
